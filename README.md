# Electronic-scoreboard
With this project being my first experience coding without any formal education, the following program might appear unnecessarily complex. How I coded the scrolling endgame message functionality is the best example of this. However, even with the excessive amount of boolean variables and timers used, the algorithm that I implemented works and a 7 segment LED message can be proudly scrolled across a 4 digit display using this method. With that said, the following code can of course be vastly improved upon and might be, if I ever decide to make a version 2 of the electronic scoreboard...

For now, I'm leaving the program in its original state, without optimization, to serve as a reminder of my very first project and the wonderful time I had learning how to code, as well as a benchmark to reflect on the progress I've made since December 2018.
