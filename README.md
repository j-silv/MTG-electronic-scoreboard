# Electronic-scoreboard
With this project being my first experience coding without any formal education, the code in the V1 folder is... unnecessarily complex. One example is the scrolling endgame message function. However, even with the excessive amount of boolean variables and timers used, the algorithm that I implemented works and a 7 segment LED message can be proudly scrolled across a 4 digit display using this method. With that said, the following code can of course be vastly improved upon and might be, if I ever decide to make a version 2 of the electronic scoreboard... (see V2 folder!)
